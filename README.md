# Programming for Performance and Ananlysis

This repository contains two advanced C++ projects. The first is a two-level cache simulator with custom replacement policies (LRU/quad-age/belady), stride prefetchers, and an analysis of various cache coherence protocols. The second project implements a concurrent producer-consumer pattern, demonstrating the use of profilers like PAPI and perf to diagnose and resolve cache contention bottlenecks.
